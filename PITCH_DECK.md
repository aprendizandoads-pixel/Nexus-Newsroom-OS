# Nexus Newsroom OS: The Future of Autonomous Publishing
## Pitch Deck & Market Strategy

---

## Slide 1: The Hook
**Title:** Journalism is Broken. Speed is the Currency.
**Visual:** A split screen. Left side: A stressed newsroom with papers flying, slow clocks. Right side: Nexus OS Dashboard, calm, with "Signals Detected" pulsing.
**Key Point:** Traditional news cycles take hours. The internet moves in seconds.

## Slide 2: The Problem
1.  **Signal Noise:** 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data created daily. Humans can't filter it.
2.  **Fragmented Tooling:** Writers use Trello + WordPress + Slack + Twitter + Feedly. Context switching kills productivity.
3.  **Inefficient Distribution:** Publishing is just step one. Formatting for TikTok, LinkedIn, and X takes 4x longer than writing the article.
